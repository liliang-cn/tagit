# Task Plan

## Goal

Continue evolving TagIt from a local prototype into a daemon-first multi-agent orchestrator with:
- PTY-backed runtime supervision
- event-store-centered execution truth
- daemon-managed prompt runs and task-graph relay runs
- inspectable queue/session/artifact/event relationships

## Current State

- `tagitd` supports daemon API, queue consumption, PTY-backed runtime execution, and graph job execution.
- `tagit` supports direct run, submit, graph run, session/artifact/event queries, and `queue inspect`.
- Queue jobs now carry `session_id`, `task_id`, and `artifact_ids`.
- Session/task/event writes now mirror into `$HOME/.tagit/tagit.db` in addition to existing file persistence.
- Direct, delegated, and graph runs can now opt into `--continuous` multi-round execution with `--max-rounds`.
- TagIt control-plane state is now anchored at `$HOME/.tagit`, while repository-targeted task execution keeps `--cwd` semantics separate from TagIt home.

## Session Plan: Wails UI (2026-03-28)

### Goal

Add a Wails-based desktop UI that sits on top of `tagitd` and the existing local API, without moving execution truth into the frontend.

### Scope Decisions

- Reuse `tagitd` as the only execution/control-plane authority.
- Reuse `internal/api` client calls instead of re-implementing orchestration in the desktop layer.
- Start with polling-based live refresh; do not block MVP on a new push transport.
- Preserve `WorkingDir` as an explicit per-run context; desktop state must not collapse repo scope into `$HOME/.tagit`.

### Phases

#### Phase W1: Desktop Architecture Baseline
Status: complete

- [x] Confirm current UI surface is Bubble Tea only; there is no Wails app yet
- [x] Confirm current daemon API already exposes enough endpoints for a desktop MVP
- [x] Confirm embedded-daemon startup pattern already exists and can be adapted from TUI

#### Phase W2: Wails Shell and Backend Bindings
Status: pending

- [ ] Add Wails dependency and app scaffold under a dedicated desktop entrypoint
- [ ] Create a desktop backend service that wraps `internal/api.Client`
- [ ] Expose minimal commands:
  - status
  - queue list / inspect / cancel
  - submit run
  - result show
  - session inspect
  - plans inbox / approve / reject
  - agent list
- [ ] Reuse embedded `tagitd` startup when no daemon is reachable

#### Phase W3: MVP Screens
Status: pending

- [ ] Dashboard: daemon health, queue counts, recovery/approval counters
- [ ] Run composer: prompt, mode, starter agent, delegates, cwd
- [ ] Queue/session detail: live task, workspace, events summary, artifacts summary
- [ ] Result view: final answer or pending state
- [ ] Plans inbox: preview, approve, reject
- [ ] Settings: agent registry path, TagIt home, current repo/cwd picker

#### Phase W4: Live UX and Interaction Model
Status: pending

- [ ] Poll daemon status and selected job/session on a short interval
- [ ] Normalize summary DTOs for frontend consumption instead of rendering raw API payloads directly
- [ ] Add optimistic UI only for non-destructive actions; refresh from daemon after every mutation
- [ ] Keep long transcripts/tails as on-demand views, not always-on background streams

#### Phase W5: Packaging and Validation
Status: pending

- [ ] Add desktop build targets and developer docs
- [ ] Verify macOS and Linux desktop startup with embedded daemon
- [ ] Add backend tests for desktop binding methods
- [ ] Add one smoke path covering submit -> inspect -> result

### Recommended Initial Slice

1. Ship Wails shell + backend bindings only.
2. Build three screens first: Dashboard, Run, Job Detail.
3. Add Plans Inbox only after the run/inspect/result path is stable.
4. Leave ACP/gateway and rich Curia visualizations for a later pass.

### Phase 19: Runtime Visibility and Attachability
Status: in_progress

- [x] Add a first-class `tagit cancel <job_id>` / daemon queue-cancel path so operators do not have to kill child processes manually
- [x] Refresh running-job timestamps and journald output with daemon heartbeats while a job is still executing
- [x] Simplify CLI entrypoints so top-level help emphasizes `run`, `submit`, `status`, `cancel`, `help`, with `agent` as management and deep inspection under `debug`
- [x] Remove built-in coding-agent registry entries so runtime selection is fully driven by user-provided profiles (`name`, `path`, `args`, PTY)
- [x] Add running-job heartbeat updates so `queue.updated_at` and top-level status change while an agent is still executing
- [x] Persist enough running-node runtime metadata for live inspection:
  - current node id

- [x] Change multi-agent `run/submit` from sequential delegate chaining to starter-bootstrap + parallel fan-out execution
- [x] Replace the user-facing `--delegate` term with `--with`, keeping `--delegate` only as a compatibility alias in argument parsing
- [x] Split TagIt control-plane state from repository execution state:
  - `$HOME/.tagit` is now the single default control root
  - daemon discovery no longer treats repo-local `.tagit` as authoritative
  - scheduler/recovery/workspace inspection now resolve workspaces from session `WorkingDir`
- [x] Make isolated workspaces the default requested mode for scheduler-dispatched tasks
- [x] Fix running-session inspection parity so daemon/API and CLI fallback return the same structure while a job is in progress
- [x] Persist runtime pid and expose it through live inspection
- [x] Emit lightweight progress events while nodes are running instead of only at node completion
- [x] Add an attach mode beyond polling tail so users can watch one running session without re-printing full inspect payloads
- [x] Make `queue tail` default to structured runtime events, with `--raw` preserving raw stdout chunks
- [x] Add a first-class user-facing session outcome artifact and expose it via `tagit result show <session_id>`
- [x] Surface `current_round`, `participant_count`, `phase`, and richer workspace metadata through live queue/session inspection
- [x] Make `queue inspect` summarized by default, with raw event/artifact expansion only when explicitly requested
- [x] Keep queue tail runtime-start pid formatting stable as an integer instead of float/scientific notation
- [x] Make `tagit result show` return a friendly pending result state for running/awaiting-approval sessions instead of failing on missing final answers
- [x] Add a Bubble Tea TUI mode that starts an embedded `tagitd` on launch and stops it on exit
- [x] Expose TUI slash commands for the everyday workflow:
  - `/agent`
  - `/with`
  - `/run`
  - `/submit`
  - `/cancel`
  - `/result`
  - `/status`

## Risks

- The runtime stream classifier is now transport/pattern/semantic layered, but it is still rules-first and not yet a mature generalized semantic parser for arbitrary agent output.
- Curia is now well beyond the original minimum and defaults disputed nodes to `Augustus` when available, but complex disputes still need more sophisticated automatic arbitration and escalation heuristics before it can be treated as fully autonomous.
- Gateway and presentation-plane work still lag the control plane and should not be described as complete.

- PTY behavior differs across coding CLIs; some still assume stronger TTY semantics.
- Current persistence is mirrored across file and SQLite backends, so read-path divergence is still possible.
- Concurrent DAG dispatch now exists for ready batches, and run/graph/recovery entrypoints now execute through `scheduler.Dispatcher`.
- Scheduler leases now persist ownership/checkpoint state in SQLite and are recovered on daemon restart.
- Real worktree isolation now exists only when the working directory is a Git repository; non-Git execution still falls back to shared-read mode.
- Continuous execution currently relies on agent-emitted `TAGIT_DONE:` markers and is still coarse-grained.
- Policy merge/apply boundaries still need tightening; current run-time path-scoped checks are stronger, and plan apply has structured conflict guidance, but fully automated conflict resolution is still not present.
- Dynamic follow-up node generation now uses structured report payloads, but follow-up validation is still permissive compared with a future formal command schema.
- Curia minimal is now real, but still human-first and score-lite; there is no Augustus arbitration or automatic dispute engine yet.
- Execution-plan apply now works through daemon API too, but it still needs richer eventing and plan-specific approval inbox UX.
- Running jobs are now observable, but the structured live view still needs richer progress semantics beyond heartbeat, pid, and workspace metadata.

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Keep exposing starter-bootstrap / parallel fan-out more clearly in queue/session summaries and structured tail output.
2. Keep refining Curia arbitration and conflict UX now that running jobs are observable.
3. Keep improving the user-facing outcome layer so `result show` can remain the main exit, not just a thin artifact wrapper.
4. Expand runtime classifier coverage beyond current approval/dangerous/parse-warning signals and surface those signals in richer queue/session summaries.
