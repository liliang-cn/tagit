# ROMA: Runtime Orchestrator for Multi-Agents

> "It just fires up all the coding agents at once and points them at the same problem." — someone

> "It not only does nothing, it also burns a lot of tokens." — someone else

## What is ROMA

ROMA runs **multiple coding agents simultaneously** — Claude, Codex, Gemini, Copilot, OpenCode, or any CLI-driven agent — and orchestrates them into a single coherent result.

Instead of asking one agent for the answer, ROMA can:

- **Parallelize**: run the same problem across multiple agents at the same time
- **Coordinate**: let a starter agent scope work, dispatch subtasks to delegate agents, and synthesize the results
- **Vote**: agents propose solutions independently, ROMA collects their outputs and runs anonymous peer review — the best proposal wins
- **Merge safely**: each agent works in an isolated `git worktree`; ROMA merges the winning implementation back to your main branch automatically via `git apply --3way`

The result is not just "what one agent said" — it's the outcome of a structured deliberation process backed by structured artifacts, event records, and policy gates.

---

**`romad`** is the kernel. It owns the queue, sessions, task states, policy checks, workspaces, artifacts, and recovery.
**`roma`** is the client. You use it to run work, inspect progress, approve plans, and debug sessions.

ROMA supports these `roma run` modes:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Rage** | Single-agent execution with worker/foreman rounds until the job is truly done. This is the default when you run with one agent. |
| **Collab** | Starter scopes work, delegates implement in parallel workspaces, and the starter reviews and synthesizes the result. |
| **Senate** | Multi-stage voting flow: agents propose plans, vote on the plan, implement against the accepted plan, then vote again on the implementations before merging the winner. |

Other execution surfaces:

- **Curia**: approval-oriented decision flow that produces a `DecisionPack` plus `ExecutionPlan`
- **Graph**: DAG execution via `roma debug graph run`, separate from `roma run`

## Install

### One-liner (Linux & macOS)

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liliang-cn/roma/main/install.sh | sh
```

Custom install directory:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liliang-cn/roma/main/install.sh | INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin sh
```

The installer:
- Detects your OS and architecture (linux/darwin × amd64/arm64)
- Uses `go install` if Go ≥ 1.22 is available, otherwise downloads a prebuilt binary from GitHub Releases
- Creates `~/.roma/` (ROMA home directory)
- Verifies the binaries actually run after installation
- Warns if the install directory is not in `PATH`

If `~/.local/bin` is not in your PATH, add it:

```sh
# zsh
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc

# bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

### Build from source

Requires Go ≥ 1.22 and git.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/liliang-cn/roma.git
cd roma
make install        # installs to ~/.local/bin
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Register agents

ROMA has no built-in agents. Register whichever CLI coding tools you have installed.
For `claude`, `codex`, and `gemini`, command arguments are filled in automatically:

```sh
roma agent add claude "Claude" $(which claude)
roma agent add codex  "Codex"  $(which codex)
roma agent add gemini "Gemini" $(which gemini)

# confirm
roma agent list
```

### 2. Start the daemon

```sh
roma start
# romad started (pid=12345, log=~/.roma/romad.log)
```

### 3. Run a task

```sh
# single agent — defaults to rage
roma run --prompt "add input validation to the user registration handler" --agent claude

# single agent from a prompt file
roma run --prompt-file ./prompt.txt --agent claude

# multi-agent — defaults to senate
roma run --prompt "refactor the payment module and add unit tests" --agent claude --with codex

# explicit collab mode
roma run --mode collab --prompt "answer a repo question" --agent codex --with claude

# two-stage plan vote + implementation vote
roma run --mode senate --prompt "build a feature and pick the best implementation" --agent codex --with gemini,claude

# explicit rage mode
roma run --mode rage --prompt "keep going until the feature is actually complete" --agent codex
```

### 4. Inspect progress

```sh
roma status                        # daemon state + queue summary
roma queue list                    # all jobs
roma queue attach <job_id>         # stream live output
roma result show <session_id>      # final result summary
```

### 5. Stop the daemon

```sh
roma stop
```

---

## Usage Reference

### Daemon management

```sh
roma start [--acp-port <port>]   # start romad in background
roma stop                         # stop romad (SIGTERM, fallback SIGKILL after 10s)
roma status                       # daemon state, queue counts, sqlite stats
```

Logs are written to `~/.roma/romad.log`. PID is stored in `~/.roma/romad.pid`.

### Running tasks

```sh
roma run (--prompt "<prompt>" | --prompt-file <path>) [--mode <collab|senate|rage>] [--agent <id>] [--with <id,...>] [--cwd <dir>] [--continuous] [--max-rounds <n>] [-d] [-f] [--verbose] [--policy-override] [--override-actor <id>]
```

Notes:
- Default mode selection is automatic: one agent uses `rage`; multiple agents use `senate`.
- `--prompt` and `--prompt-file` are mutually exclusive; one of them is required.
- Default behavior is `-f`: submit, follow progress, and print the final result when the run completes.
- Use `-d` to submit in the background and return immediately.
- `--verbose` prints per-node execution details instead of only the main progress lines.
- `rage` is single-agent only.
- `collab` uses the starter agent plus delegates named by `--with`.

### Queue management

```sh
roma queue list [--status <status>]   # list jobs
roma queue show <job_id>              # job details as JSON
roma queue attach <job_id>            # stream output in real time
roma approve <job_id>                 # approve a pending job
roma reject  <job_id>                 # reject a pending job
roma cancel  <job_id>                 # cancel a running job
```

### Agent management

```sh
roma agent list
roma agent add <id> <name> <path> [--arg <arg>] [--alias <a>] [--pty] [--mcp] [--json]
roma agent remove <id>
roma agent inspect <id>
```

### Results and history

```sh
roma result show <session_id>
roma debug session list
roma debug session show <session_id>
roma debug task list --session <session_id>
roma debug event list --session <session_id>
roma debug artifact list --session <session_id>
roma debug artifact show <artifact_id>
```

### Graph (DAG) execution

```sh
roma debug graph run --file examples/curia-test.json
```

## TUI Mode

Launch the interactive terminal UI:

```sh
roma tui
romatui
```

The TUI starts an embedded `romad` automatically and stops it on exit. Available slash commands:

```
/help                 show help
/status               daemon and queue status
/agent <id>           set active agent
/with <a,b,...>       set delegate agents
/run <prompt>         run task and stream output
/submit <prompt>      submit task asynchronously
/open <job_id>        open job output
/cancel [job_id]      cancel a job
/result [session_id]  show session result
```

## Desktop UI

A first Wails desktop UI now lives under [`desktop/`](./desktop).

It keeps the same daemon-first model as the CLI and TUI:

- desktop UI is presentation only
- `romad` remains execution truth
- the desktop app connects to an existing daemon or starts an embedded one

Current desktop MVP covers:

- daemon status
- run submission
- queue inspection
- result view
- plans inbox

See [`desktop/README.md`](./desktop/README.md) for build and platform notes.

## How Merge-Back Works

Agents run in isolated git worktrees under `~/.roma/workspaces/`. When an agent finishes and emits:

```
ROMA_MERGE_BACK: direct_merge | <reason>
ROMA_MERGE_FILE: path/to/changed/file
```

ROMA automatically applies the patch back to the main repository using `git apply --3way`. If there are conflicts or policy blocks, the merge is held for manual review.

## Development

```sh
make build    # build to bin/
make test     # run full test suite with -race
make install  # install to ~/.local/bin
```
